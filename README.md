# Ouya Controller Steam Configuration

This is a little tutorial for use an Ouya controller in steam.

## Motivation
I have an Ouya and is a cool paperweight. I was bored and i wanted to play [Super Meat Boy](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40800/). I'm a very occacional gamer and i don't want buy an xbox controller for play 30 or 40 minutes. So i tried to use my Ouya controller for play steam in my Arch Linux system. This repository contains the knowledge obtained during my experiment, i did this in an Antergos Distro, but i think that is possible implements in others Linux Distros.
